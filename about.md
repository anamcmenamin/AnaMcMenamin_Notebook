Department of Biological Sciences  
University of Rhode Island

### Education 
2018 – Current  
University of Rhode Island: Doctor of Philosophy in Evolutionary and Marine Biology  
Dissertation focus: Characterizing coral holobiont physiological and (epi)genomic responses to multivariate stressors 
in order to inform sustainable conservation efforts. 

2014 – 2018  
Loyola Marymount University: Bachelors of Science in Biology

### Current Research Aims

The overall goal of my dissertation research is to characterize coral holobiont response to environmental change by examining physiological performance, (epi)genomics, and microbiome communities response to stress to inform more sustainable coral restoration plans. This interdisciplinary approach is taken to evaluate transgenerational acclimatization and phenotypic plasticity of the coral holobiont in order to advance work in assisted evolution and selective breeding for conservation.
